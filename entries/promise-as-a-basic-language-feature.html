</code></pre><p></div></div></p><p>A primitive operation that found itself in a less than desirable state can simply... Not resolve and terminate via rejection. This rejection can be optionally handled elsewhere - in this case via <code>&amp;catch</code>. Admittedly though, implementing <code>&amp;catch</code> requires <code>&gt;&gt;=-handle</code> which is a binder analogous to <code>handle</code> in operation, except it takes a a function returning promise as its second argument, much like <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.</p><p>Now let's focus on adding concurrency to the mix. Assuming atomic updates to <code>&#42;promises&#42;</code> and each promise individually we merely need to parallelize <code>run-all!</code>, and since each <code>thunk</code> is fairly self-contained this ought to be pretty easy. Moreover, since we're using asynchronous promises we don't need to worry at all about the order of execution! We just need to run all thunks in any order whatsoever and that's it:</p><p><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3"></p><pre><code class="scheme">&#40;set! &#42;promises&#42; &#40;shuffle &#42;promises&#42;&#41;&#41; ;; Everything still works.

There's nothing inherently binding promise execution strategy to the actual computation it conveys. All we need under the hood is a queue of promises awaiting execution and something that will execute them - for instance a <strong>thread pool</strong> would do nicely here and is fairly simple to implement.</p><p>So... Now that we have it laid out like this it really does look quite similar to how Haskell handles non-strictness and the concurrency perks are nice...</p><p>Wait a minute! Does this mean this weird idea is actually viable!?</p><h2><a name="cps"></a><a href="#cps">CPS</a></h2>Let's instead focus for a moment on an alternative approach to implementing concurrency in a programming language - the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model'>Actor Model</a>. In Actor Model all concurrent computation is performed by so-called Actors - lightweight processes that synchronize themselves using message passing.<p>Implementing such a thing is quite a bit more complex than using a thread pool, especially if we aim to compile down to an Actor Model-based language. Fortunately enough, there's a clever technique that makes it a little bit easier - it's called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style'>Continuation Passing Style</a> or <strong>CPS</strong> for short. CPS itself is quite straightforward - all you're really doing is calling another function instead of returning a value, but just as these things tend to turn out, it has some mind-boggling implications. For starters, sometimes it's really hard to understand what's going on in the code - and I mean <strong>really hard</strong> -, especially if some clever use of <em>continuations</em> is in progress. Another complex thing about CPS is the CPS-transform - a nontrivial task of converting direct-style (the <em>regular</em> kind) code into continuation passing style. For these reasons I won't dive too deep into the CPS, so let's assume we both read and understood bits of the wikipedia page on the topic, and let's see some spaghetti code.

Noticeably, in CPS there's no need to wrap any values in anything, we just use their... Well, <em>values</em>. The second obvious thing is the <em>similarity</em> to using Promises - what we have here is two callbacks, one resolving and the other rejecting a value, ordered in such a way that running one <code>resolve</code> cascades and recursively resolves more promises. Pretty clever. On the other hand, error handling is not clever at all - all we need to do in order to install a new error handler is... Well, just pass a different one along, that's it. Language-wise, this requires CPS-transform support, but conceptually beats <code>&amp;catch</code> any time.</p><p>Unfortunately, we can't do anything <em>fun</em> with this <code>factorial</code>, since it just executes until completion. If we were to run one inside of an actor - it would hog the entire processor core, preventing any other actors from running on it. Needlessly to say, this is undesirable and we need to fix it. Fortunately, the fix for this is quite simple - we'll voluntarily yield execution and let the runtime decide which continuation to run next:</p><p><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3"></p><pre><code class="scheme">&#40;define &#42;continuation&#42; '&#40;&#41;&#41;

This works especially well with the Actor Model, where we already have a perfect place to store such a continuation (the actor itself), plus an actor already represents an on-going process, which an unterminated continuation is.</p><p>Asynchronity is achievable on inter-continuation level. What I mean by that is, basically, that we can spin up a new actor or a few new actors that will perform asynchronous computations and return results whenever available. It's not as sexy as Promises, but if it's good enough for Erlang, then it's definitely good enough for me.</p><h2><a name="conclusions-_-benchmark"></a><a href="#conclusions-_-benchmark">Conclusions & benchmark</a></h2>Now, back to the viability question. We've seen two potential implementations of concurrency in a programming language runtime - both having their perks and trade-offs. The CPS-based one has a somewhat proven track record of me implementing <a href='https://github.com/Idorobots/foof'>an Actor Model-based programming language</a>, where CPS enabled some nice additional features. However, <a href='https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/actors_vs_futures.html'>some people argue</a> that Promises are <strong>the</strong> way to go and Actor Model should be avoided. I don't buy into that argument, but having uniform and transparent treatment of synchronous and asynchronous code sure does look nice... Let's do some half-assed performance benchmarking to help us decide!<p>(All benchmarks are presented with a baseline of direct-style, synchronous Scheme implementation and are meant to be taken with a grain of salt, after all this is a sample of 1 and my <code>Promise</code> implementation probably is a bit wonky. What should be noted though, is the performance to straightforwardness of implementation ratio of different approaches, which this benchmark highlights. All presented times are in milliseconds.)</p><p>Running 1000 iterations of four versions of <code>&#40;fibonacci 18&#41;</code> on a single core:</p><p><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"></p><pre><code class="scheme">baseline:  &#40;&#40;real-time . 0.032&#41;  &#40;cpu-time . 0.03&#41;   &#40;gc-time . 0&#41;&#41;

As previously briefly mentioned, promises have a lot in common with laziness and, unfortunately, share some of its drawbacks as well. In this case, the benchmark creates a large number of simultaneously existing promises resulting in excessive memory allocation, coping and GC pauses. There are ways to fix it, but these entail much complication to the implementation. Not something I want to explore right now.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the CPS version with yield seems to be about 10 times slower than the plain CPS version, which in turn is about 10 times slower than the baseline.
